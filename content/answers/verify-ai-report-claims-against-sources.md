**TL;DR** — Verify claims in a report against the saved sources. Index those files, then run one `match_phrase` per claim. A claim with no hit is unverified. On 2026-10-20, 3 of 5 phrases were in the docs index and 2 were not. The first check took 490 ms.

XERJ is a new way for AI to search for data.

## One phrase, one claim

The capture indexed `docs/` (wall 14.3 s, exit 3, 9,940 records) and queried `docs-docs`, whose prose field is `body`.

```sh
curl -s -XPOST http://127.0.0.1:9217/docs-docs/_search -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"size":1,"_source":["ax_path","title"],"query":{"match_phrase":{"body":"the primary user is an AI agent"}}}'
```

Found. `ax_path` was `WHY_XERJ.md`. `took` was 490.

The next phrase, `shares no code and no architecture`, was found in `ARCHITECTURE.md` (2 hits) and took 485 ms. `point-at-folder` was found in `WHY_XERJ.md` and took 1 ms.

## What a miss means

Two phrases were not found, each with `took` 1.

`Content sniffing never trusts the extension` is a rewording. The file does not contain that sentence. The check correctly refused it.

`XERJ is a fork of Lucene` is not in the file either. The check refused it too. A miss does not say the sentence is false in the world. It says these words are not in the field you searched.

The same five phrases against `text` on the same index returned 0 hits, and each `took` was 0. Wrong field, silent empty. `xerj autoindex map` is how you learn the field name.

## Measured on 2026-10-20

| Phrase on `body` | Result | `took` |
|---|---|---|
| the primary user is an AI agent | Found, `WHY_XERJ.md` | 490 ms |
| shares no code and no architecture | Found, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, 2 hits | 485 ms |
| point-at-folder | Found, `WHY_XERJ.md` | 1 ms |
| Content sniffing never trusts the extension | Not found | 1 ms |
| XERJ is a fork of Lucene | Not found | 1 ms |
| Same five phrases on `text` | 0 hits each | `took` 0 |

The first two checks were slower than the three that followed. Those are the measured times, not a single combined figure. One node, binary v1.0.0-rc.97.

A phrase match does not prove a claim. It shows the words are present.

## When not to use XERJ

If the report paraphrases, or writes a number in a different form, this check will miss a true sentence. Use it for claims you can quote, and treat a miss as "not in this field", not as a verdict.
