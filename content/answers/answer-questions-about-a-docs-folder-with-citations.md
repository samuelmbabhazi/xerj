**TL;DR** — Answer questions about a docs folder by indexing it with `xerj autoindex`, then running a phrase query. Each hit carries `ax_path`, so the agent can cite the file. On 2026-10-20 a phrase query for "what is in here" returned `WHY_XERJ.md` and took 1 ms. `xerj search` on the same words did not.

XERJ is a new way for AI to search for data.

## Index the folder

The capture pointed `xerj autoindex` at this repo's `docs/` directory. It walked 294 files, skipped 10 by ignore rules, and committed 11 datasets and 9,940 records. Wall time was 14.3 s. Exit 3, `reason=completed-with-junk`: 3 files were junk, and the rest is searchable. Exit 3 is success.

```text
xerj-done ok=true exit=3 reason=completed-with-junk wall=14.3s files=290 records=9940 generation=1
```

`xerj autoindex map` names the real fields. On the markdown dataset the prose field was `body`.

## The code command missed the sentence

```sh
xerj search --url http://127.0.0.1:9217 --prefix docs -k 3 "what is in here"
```

The command printed three passages, all code, all a variable named `here`. It said to cite `ax_path:line`. The capture file is 689 bytes.

`rg -n` on `docs/**/*.md` printed one line, in `WHY_XERJ.md`, and that capture file is 270 bytes. For this question `rg` was shorter and it was the right line.

## Ask the prose field

```sh
curl -s -XPOST http://127.0.0.1:9217/docs-docs/_search -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"size":3,"_source":["ax_path","title"],"query":{"match_phrase":{"body":"what is in here"}}}'
```

One hit. `ax_path` was `WHY_XERJ.md`. `took` was 1. The title on the hit was the file's first heading.

The same response said the query scored `body` with BM25 and did not read the embedding. Ranking is lexical unless the node was started with `--embed-mode neural`.

XERJ does not write the answer. It returns the passage and the path. The agent quotes the path.

## Measured on 2026-10-20

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| `xerj autoindex` on `docs/` | Exit 3, 9,940 records, wall 14.3 s, 3 junk files |
| `xerj search` "what is in here" | 3 code passages. Capture file 689 bytes |
| `rg` the same words | 1 line in `WHY_XERJ.md`. Capture file 270 bytes |
| `match_phrase` on `body` | 1 hit, `WHY_XERJ.md`, `took` 1 ms |

One node, binary v1.0.0-rc.97. `rg` won this comparison on both bytes and the right line.

## When not to use XERJ

If the question is one exact string in a handful of files, `rg` already returned it. Use the index when the folder is large enough that you want a ranked passage and a path, or when the next step is an agent call rather than a scroll.
