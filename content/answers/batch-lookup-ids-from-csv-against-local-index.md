**TL;DR** — Look up 1,000 IDs against a local index with one `terms` query, then mark each ID found or not found. On 2026-10-20 the query sent 1,000 numbers over 532 issues. The response `took` was 0. 532 IDs were in the index and 468 were not.

XERJ is a new way for AI to search for data.

## One terms query

The id field on the issue export was `number`, type `long`. The capture built 1,000 integers: every issue number in the export, then unused integers up to 1,000. The list is `04-ids.txt`.

```sh
curl -s -XPOST http://127.0.0.1:9217/gh-jsonl/_search -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"size":0,"track_total_hits":true,"query":{"terms":{"number":[960,488,484]}}}'
```

The command above shows the shape with three ids. The captured body sent all 1,000. `size` 0 asks for the count. The response was `took` 0 and `hits.total.value` 532. The other 468 ids were absent. Found or not found is that comparison. It is not a per-id abstain feature.

Guessing the index name `gh-issues` returned HTTP 404. The issues lived in `gh-jsonl`.

## _msearch needs the real name

A wildcard header did not expand:

```text
{"index":"gh-*"}
```

The HTTP status of the call was 200. The item inside was status 404, `no such index [gh-*]`.

The same call with `{"index":"gh-jsonl"}` and 6 issue numbers returned item status 200, `took` 0, and 6 hits.

## One fuzzy query, nothing more

```sh
curl -s -XPOST http://127.0.0.1:9217/gh-jsonl/_search -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"size":3,"_source":["number","title","state"],"query":{"match":{"title":{"query":"feedbak open-pr","fuzziness":"AUTO"}}}}'
```

`took` was 1. 13 hits. Issue 960 was first, then 488, then 1837. That is the whole observation.

## Measured on 2026-10-20

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| 1,000 ids, `terms` on `gh-jsonl` | `took` 0. 532 found, 468 absent |
| `_msearch` index `gh-*` | Item status 404, `no such index [gh-*]` |
| `_msearch` index `gh-jsonl`, 6 ids | Item status 200, 6 found, `took` 0 |
| `fuzziness` `AUTO` on `feedbak open-pr` | Issue 960 first, 13 hits, `took` 1 ms |
| Index name `gh-issues` | HTTP 404 |

## When not to use XERJ

If the ids are exact and they already live in one table, a SQL join is the smaller tool. Use the terms query when the ids are a file and the records are an index you already built.
